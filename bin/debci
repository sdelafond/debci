debci - Debian Continuous Integration

=encoding utf8
=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<debci> I<COMMAND> [I<OPTIONS>] [I<ARGUMENTS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<debci> is the main entry point for debci programs. Most of the commands are
intended to be used by the debci system itself. However, there are a few
commands that are useful for users, and they are listed below.

=over

=item B<debci setup> [I<OPTIONS>]

Sets up a test bed for running local tests. For most of the backends, this
should be usually ran as root.

=item B<debci localtest> [I<OPTIONS>] I<SOURCEPACKAGE> [I<BINARY> ...]

Runs the tests from I<SOURCEPACKAGE>, in exactly the same way they would be ran
on I<ci.debian.net>.

I<SOURCEPACKAGE> can be a source package name, a local I<.dsc> file, a local
I<.changes> file, a local unpacked source package directory, or anything else
that B<autopkgtest(1)> would take as a source package.

You can also pass any quantity of I<BINARY> packages that will also be used in
the test.

=back

=head1 COMMON OPTIONS

The following options apply to every debci command.


=over

=item -c DIR, --config DIR

=item -a ARCH, --arch ARCH

selects the architecture to run tests for (default: host architecture)

=item -b BACKEND, --backend BACKEND

selects the backends to run tests on (default: lxc)

=item  -s SUITE, --suite SUITE

selects suite to run tests for (default: unstable)

=item -d DIR, --data-dir DIR

The directory in which debci will store its data, and where it will read from.

=item --amqp amqp://[user:password@]hostname[:port]

AMQP server to connect to (default: amqp://localhost)

=item  -q, --quiet

Prevents debci from producing any output on stdout. Errors and warnings will
still be sent to stderr.
