debci (1.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release includes a change to use the new autopkgtest CLI, i.e.
  invocations of `adt-run` are replaced by `autopkgtest` throughout. This also
  means that the testbeds (chroots, containers) created by `debci setup`
  should now be called `autopkgtest-*` instead of `adt-*`.

  If you don't usually run `debci test`, you don't need to do anything.

  If you do use `debci test`, you will need to re-run `debci setup` so that
  the base testbeds are correctly created. Alternatively, you can:

  - if you have debci-worker installed, wait for the next scheduled execution
    of `debci setup` (see /etc/cron.daily/debci-worker), or
  - call `debci setup` as root before your next use of `debci test`.
